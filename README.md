# My Second Brain

This project is a website built using **React** and the fancy-pants **Docusaurus** framework. It's like a nerdy playground of knowledge, where you can find all sorts of cool and interesting articles and notes on topics like coding, space, and music.

The website is organized into a series of folders, each representing a main topic. Inside each main topic folder, you'll find sub-topic folders that contain the actual articles and notes. We use the file naming conventions recommended by Docusaurus, so you'll see things like "docs" and "website" scattered throughout the folder structure.

The content of the articles and notes is written in Markdown and React MDX, which allows us to add all sorts of cool formatting and interactive elements to make the content more engaging. And speaking of engaging, we use Docusaurus' "wrappers" to add some extra flair to the site's design.

We hope you have a blast exploring all the amazing content on My Second Mind. Happy reading!
