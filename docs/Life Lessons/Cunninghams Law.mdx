According to **Cunningham's Law** _(which is like the ultimate rule for getting answers on the internet)_,
the best way to get the right answer to a question is to post the wrong answer.
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, but just bear with me.

Here's how it works: when you post a question online, there's always a chance that someone will give you the wrong answer.
But if you're the one who posts the wrong answer, chances are someone will come along and correct you.
And when they do, they'll probably give you the right answer too. It's like a reverse psychology thing, you know?

Now, I know what you're thinking -

> #### "Why on earth would I want to post the wrong answer just to get the right answer?"

Well, here's the thing: sometimes, when you're trying to solve a problem, it helps to know what doesn't work.
That way, you can rule out the wrong answers and focus on the right ones. And that's exactly what Cunningham's Law is all about.

So there you have it! If you want to get the right answer on the internet,
just pretend like you're clueless and wait for someone to come along and set you straight.
Just don't be surprised if you get a few strange looks along the way.
