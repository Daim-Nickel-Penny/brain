Hey there! So right now, I'm deep in the coding game, using VS Code for most of my work. My go-to
languages are `TypeScript`, `Java`, `React`, `Nest`, and `Spring Boot`. I used to rely heavily on
**VS Code** for my TypeScript and React projects, and **IntelliJ IDEA** for Java, but I've recently
decided to take the leap and switch to NeoVim.

Now, I know what you're thinking: **"Whoa, that's some serious commitment."** And you're right, it
is. But hear me out. I've been hearing all these great things about Vim for years now, and I've
finally decided to give it a shot. I'm still learning the ropes, but once I get the hang of it, I'll
start sharing my **Vim** journey right here.

But in the meantime, I'm sticking with VS Code. It's been my trusty companion for a while now, and I
have to admit, I'll miss its pretty little face. But I'm ready to level up my productivity and
speed, and Vim seems like the way to go. Plus, it's lightning fast, even when opening large
projects. Can't argue with that, am I right?

So wish me luck on my journey to Vim mastery, and in the meantime, I'll be here, hacking away on VS
Code. Cheers!
