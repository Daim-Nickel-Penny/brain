Hey there! I just wanted to tell you a little bit about Brain. It's this cool site that I've been working on,
and I'm super excited to finally be launching it.

## What is Brain, you ask?

Well, it's kind of hard to explain. It's like a cross between a virtual brainstorming session,
a giant encyclopedia of weird and interesting things, and a giant brain party.
I mean, it's not like any of those things exactly, but it's kind of like all of them put together.

## Its Our Brain

Basically, I wanted to create a place where I could share all the random bits of knowledge and trivia that I come across,
and where other people could share their own weird and interesting stuff too.
And since I'm a big believer in the power of collaboration, I figured it would be even better if we could all share our
ideas and insights and whatnot.

But here's the thing: Brain isn't just for me. It's for everyone. If you've got some weird and interesting tidbits that you want to share with the world, this is the place to do it. And even if you don't have anything to share, that's okay too. Just come and hang out, and see what kind of cool stuff other people are talking about.

## Ring Ring? Brain is nothing new?

Now, I know what you're thinking:

:::caution
"Oh great, another content sharing platform. Just what the world needs." - Karen

But hold on a sec! **Brain** is actually a little bit different from your average content sharing platform.
It's not just about sharing content for the sake of it.
It's about sharing the weird, interesting, and offbeat stuff that you just don't see anywhere else.

You know how it goes: you're scrolling through your social media feed, and it's all the same old stuff.
There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but sometimes you just want something a little bit different.
Something that makes you go **"hmm, that's cool."**

Well, that's where Brain comes in. It's a place where you can share all the weird and interesting things that you come across,
and where other people can share their own weird and interesting stuff too.
It's like a virtual brainstorming session, but with a lot more tangents and weird rabbit holes.

So while it might seem like just another content sharing platform at first glance,
Brain is actually something a little bit different.

## But wait, For free?

Well, that's a tough question. I mean, is anything really **"free"** in this world?
I mean, sure, you don't have to pay money to use Brain, but there is a cost involved.

You see, every time you use Brain, you have to pay in brain cells. And let me tell you, those brain cells don't come cheap.
I mean, have you ever tried to buy brain cells on the open market? It's a bloodbath out there.

But in all seriousness, yes, **Brain is totally free to use**.
You don't have to pay a dime, or even a penny (which, by the way, are also worth more than brain cells these days).
So go ahead and use Brain as much as you want.
Just try not to strain your brain too much, or you might have to start borrowing brain cells from your pets.
Trust me, they don't have many to spare.

## How do you maintain this?

Maintaining Brain is a bit of a balancing act, let me tell you. On the one hand,
I'm working on it all by myself right now, which can be a bit overwhelming at times.
But on the other hand, I absolutely love working on this site and I wouldn't have it any other way.

That being said, I could definitely use a little help every now and then.
So if you're reading this and you're feeling a little bit helpful (or just want to get in on the weird and interesting action),
don't be shy! You can either reach out to me directly, or you can make a pull request on GitHub if you want to contribute some content.
Either way, I'm always happy to have a little bit of extra help.

And no, I don't pay myself for working on Brain. Mostly because I don't have any money to pay myself with.
But also because the joy of sharing weird and interesting things with the world is payment enough.
So if you're feeling a little bit generous and want to throw a few brain cells my way, I won't say no.
Just don't tell my pets, they're already feeling a little bit tapped out.

## Can I copy content?

Well, the short answer is yes, you can absolutely copy content from Brain.
I mean, it's not like we have any kind of high-tech security measures in place or anything like that.
In fact, we kind of encourage people to share our content.
After all, the whole point of Brain is to share the weird and interesting things we come across with as many people as possible.

That being said, it would be really awesome if you could make sure to mention Brain whenever you share our content.
That way, more people will know about us and we can all share even more weird and interesting stuff. And who doesn't want that?

So go ahead and share away! Just make sure to give us a little shout-out while you're at it.
And hey, if you're feeling extra generous, you can even send us a few brain cells as a thank you.
Trust me, we'll put them to good use. Because let's be real, we could all use a little bit more weird and interesting in our lives.

## Brain Behind The Brain

Well, I have to say that my cat has definitely been one of the most helpful contributors to Brain.
I mean, he's always there for me, offering support and encouragement (not to mention the occasional headbutt or purr).
He's even been known to help out with the front-end development from time to time,
which is no small feat considering he has zero formal training in computer science.

But in all seriousness, I have to give a big thank you to all of the contributors to Brain. Whether you're a human, a feline, or something in between,
I appreciate your help and support in making this site a success.
Without all of you, Brain wouldn't be nearly as weird and interesting as it is today.

If you want to see a full list of contributors, you can check out the GitHub page.
But really, I want to give a shout-out to everyone who has helped make Brain what it is today. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

## Where's my Question?

If your question doesn't get answered, don't worry! There could be any number of reasons for that, and it's definitely not personal.
Maybe I was too busy scratching my head trying to come up with a good joke,
or maybe I just wasn't feeling particularly witty at the time. Either way, it's no big deal.

If you really want to make sure your question gets answered, the best thing to do is to contact me directly.
You can find my Twitter handle in the footer of the site, and I'm always happy to chat.
But I'll do my best!

And hey, if you don't hear back from me right away, don't worry.
I'm not ignoring you, I promise.
I'm just probably busy updating my cat's LinkedIn profile or something like that.
You know how it is.

## Is content here reliable?

Hey, don't worry about the reliability of the content on Brain! We take great care to verify everything before we publish it.
But hey, we're only human. Sometimes things slip through the cracks and mistakes happen.

If you notice something that you think might be incorrect, don't hesitate to let us know.
You can either report it to us via **GitHub**, or check out our **updates and issues** page for more information on how to report problems.

Just keep in mind that the information on Brain should not be considered 100% reliable,
and we can't be held responsible for any issues that may arise from using it.
But we'll do our best to make sure everything is accurate and up-to-date. So, don't worry and have fun exploring Brain!

## Why Open Source?

Yes, our code is open sourced! We believe in the power of collaboration and think that open source is the way to go.
That's why we've made our code available for anyone to see and make changes to.

We think it's important to promote open source because it allows for more people to contribute
and helps to create a better product for everyone. Plus, it's just a really cool way to work.

So if you're interested in checking out our code, feel free to take a look.
And if you have any suggestions or want to make some changes, don't be shy!
We're always happy to have more people working with us to improve Brain.
Just keep it chill, and have fun!

Just follow these simple steps:

- Open up your web browser on your phone (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
