Everything in <Highlight color={Colors.JavaScriptYellow}>JavaScript</Highlight> happens inside the execution context. Imagine a sealed-off container
inside which <Highlight color={Colors.JavaScriptYellow}>JavaScript</Highlight> runs. It is an abstract concept that holds info about the env. within
the current code is being executed.

<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/js-w-e.png")} width="600rem" height="200rem" />

- In the container, the first component is the **memory component** and the 2nd one is the **code component**
- The memory component has all the variables and functions in key-value pairs. It is also called a **Variable environment**.
- Code component is the place where code is executed one line at a time. It is also called the **Thread of Execution**.
- JS is a **synchronous**, **single-threaded** language
  - Synchronous:- One command at a time.
  - Single-threaded:- In a specific synchronous order.
