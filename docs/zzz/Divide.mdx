# ÷ (Divide)

Every time I've parted ways with someone I care about, it's like my world is thrown completely
off-kilter. I know it's a cliché, but it really does feel like someone's ripped my heart out and
stomped on it. I find myself skipping proper sleep, staying up until the wee hours of the morning
staring at the ceiling and thinking about all the good times we had.

### Attaching Memories to People

It's weird - I have this habit of attaching people to everything in my life. Every memory, every
song, every stupid little thing reminds me of them. And even though I know it's not healthy, part of
me wants to share all those memories with my closest friends and family, like they'll somehow be
able to take away the pain. But it backfires on me every time. I end up feeling more isolated and
alone, like nobody could possibly understand what I'm going through.

### Work as a Distraction

To distract myself, I tend to throw myself into work. I'll work long hours, sometimes even pulling
all-nighters just to keep myself busy. But no matter how hard I try to focus, my mind keeps
wandering back to that one person, replaying all our memories like a broken record. And then, before
I know it, I'm arguing with someone over the smallest thing, just because I'm so angry and confused
about my own emotions.

### Dealing with the Silly, Funny, Emotional Side

I don't know if any of this makes sense, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that heartbreak is a
weird and complicated thing. It's _silly_ and _funny_ and _emotional_ all at the same time, and it
can make you feel like you're going crazy. But even though it's tough, I know that it's just a part
of life. And who knows? Maybe one day, when I look back on all of this, I'll be able to laugh at how
_silly_ I was being. But for now, all I can do is take it one day at a time, and try to focus on the
good things in life.
