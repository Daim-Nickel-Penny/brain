## Basic Setup

To set up a <Highlight color={Colors.TypeScriptBlue}>TypeScript</Highlight> project in Node.js using the TypeScript compiler (tsc), follow these steps:

1. Install the TypeScript compiler by running `npm install -g typescript` . This will install the TypeScript compiler globally on your system, allowing you to run it from the command line.

2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.

3. Run `tsc --init` to create a **tsconfig.json** file in your project directory. This file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler and specify the options for your project.

4. Open the **tsconfig.json** file in a text editor and set the "outDir" option to specify the directory where you want the compiled JavaScript files to be placed. For example:

   ```js
   {
   "compilerOptions": {
       "outDir": "./build"
   }
   }
   ```

5. Create a src directory in your project and add a TypeScript file to it. For example, you might create a file called src/index.ts with the following contents:

   ```js
   function greet(name: string) {
     console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   }

   greet("World");
   ```

6. Run tsc to compile your TypeScript code. This will generate a JavaScript file in the build directory with the same name as your TypeScript file, in this case **build/index.js**.

7. Run **node build/index.js** to execute the compiled JavaScript file. This should print "Hello, World!" to the console.

   That's it! You've set up a TypeScript project in Node.js using the tsc compiler.

## Nodemon to Automatically Update

To add nodemon to a <Highlight color={Colors.TypeScriptBlue}>TypeScript</Highlight> project, you will need to install it as a development dependency:

1. Run `npm install --save-dev nodemon` to install nodemon and add it to the devDependencies section of your project's **package.json** file.

2. Create a script in the **package.json** file that runs nodemon with the TypeScript compiler. For example:

   ```js
   {
   "scripts": {
       "start": "nodemon -e ts --exec 'tsc && node'"
   }
   }
   ```

   :::info
   This script tells nodemon to watch for changes to TypeScript (.ts) files and, when a change is detected, to run the TypeScript compiler (tsc) and then execute the compiled JavaScript file with node.
   :::

3. To start the project with nodemon, run npm start. This will start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and nodemon will automatically restart the app when it detects a change to your TypeScript files.
   :::tip
   **Note**: If you want to specify the entry point for your app, you can modify the script to include the path to your main TypeScript file. For example:
   :::

   ```js
   "start": "nodemon -e ts --exec 'tsc -p src && node src/index.js'"
   ```

   This script tells nodemon to run the TypeScript compiler with the -p src option to specify the src directory as the root of the TypeScript project, and to execute the compiled JavaScript file at src/index.js with node.
