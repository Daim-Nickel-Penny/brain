Just wanted to give you a quick update on what's going on behind the scenes.
First of all, you may have noticed that the **sidebar** isn't perfectly organized at the moment.
Don't worry, **I'm working on it!** I'm trying to figure out the best way to organize
all the amazing content on this site, so bear with me while I get everything sorted
out.

## Suggestions

If you have any ideas on how to improve the organization of the sidebar,
I'd love to hear them! You can either contribute your ideas through **GitHub**
(just follow the steps in the previous messages to get started) or reach out to me on **Twitter**.

Either way, I'm all ears!

In the meantime, I'm also working on adding more content to the site.
There's so much to learn and explore, and I want to make sure My Second Mind has something for everyone.
So stay tuned for more articles and notes in the coming weeks!
