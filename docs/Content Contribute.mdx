### Contributor's Symptoms

- **Are you bursting with cool ideas about coding, space, music, or anything else?**
- **Do you want to share your knowledge with the world (or at least with the folks who visit My Second Brain)?**

:::danger
**Great news:** you can totally do that!
:::

### Steps

If you see a page on our website that you think could use a little something extra, just scroll to bottom and click on this
`"Edit this page"`. This will take you to our [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Daim-Nickel-Penny/brain/)
repository, where all the magic happens.

- Once you're on GitHub, you'll see a bunch of folders and files. **Don't be intimidated!**
- It's actually really easy to add your own content.
- Just find the folder that corresponds to the main topic you want to write about, and create a new folder inside it for your sub-topic.
- Then, create a new file inside your sub-topic folder using the "Create new file" button.
- Next, give your file a name **(make sure it ends in ".md"!)** and start writing!

  :::info
  You can use the **Markdown syntax** to format your text and add links, images, and other cool stuff.
  :::

- When you're done writing, make a "pull request" (or "PR" for short) to submit your changes for review.
- Our team of **content ninjas** will take a look and make sure everything is good to go.
- If it is, your contribution will be added to the website for everyone to see!

**Still Tricky?** DM me on twitter [Twitter](https://twitter.com/i_am_daim).
