### Day Job

<MusicPlayer songPath={sugarMp3} />

## Chorus

I don't wanna work my day job  
But I got bills I gotta pay off  
It may not be good manners  
But I don't wanna be staring at a screen  
Pretending that it matters at my day job  
But my retirement is still a way off  
I'm afraid of what it's made me  
I'm stressed out  
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to get out  
[Sigh]

## Verse 1

This white collar is a little too tight  
I'm struggling to breathe and all I see  
Is squares of white blue light  
I might not make it in tomorrow  
Sorry for the fake deadlines that I broke  
Hey, middle manager  
I sold you my best years and my posture  
To be one more body making your wheel spin  
So nine to five I'm only thinking one thing

## Chorus

I don't wanna work my day job  
But I got bills I gotta pay off  
It may not be good manners  
But I don't wanna be staring at a screen  
Pretending that it matters at my day job  
But my retirement is still a way off  
I'm afraid of what it's made me  
I'm stressed out  
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to get out

## Verse 2

I should feel lucky that I got one  
Unemployment is a real problem  
I should save for something, I don't know yet  
Real estate never got me going  
I should climb the ladder that I wanna be on  
And stop complaining that I'm just a corporate peon  
To be honest  
It's someone else's dream  
But it ain't me, and that's alright  
Yeah, it's okay  
But is it too much to ask to not feel  
Like I'm wasting away

## Chorus

Whenever I'm working at my day job  
But I got bills I gotta pay off  
It may not be good manners  
But I don't wanna be staring at a screen  
Pretending that it matters at my day job  
But my retirement is still a way off  
I'm afraid of what it's made me  
I'm stressed out  
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to get out

## Bridge

I don't wanna work my, I don't wanna work my  
I don't wanna work my, I don't wanna work my  
I don't wanna work my, I don't wanna work my  
I don't wanna work my day job  
Day job, day job  
I don't wanna work my, I don't wanna work my  
I don't wanna work my, I don't wanna work my  
I don't wanna work my, I don't wanna work my  
I don't wanna work my day job  
Day job, day job

## Outro

50 years from now what would I spend  
To live today again  
50 years from now will my savings account  
Be worth what I'm missing now  
Working at my day job  
But I got bills I gotta pay off  
It may not be good manners  
But I don't wanna be  
Staring at a screen  
Pretending that it matters  
At my day job  
But my retirement is still a way off  
I'm afraid of what it's made me  
I'm stressed out  
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to get out
