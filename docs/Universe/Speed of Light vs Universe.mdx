So here's the deal: **the universe is really big**, and it's always getting bigger.
But even though it's expanding, there's a special rule that says nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.
It's like a rule that everyone has to follow, no matter what.

Now, here's the tricky part:

:::caution
**even though things can't travel faster than the speed of light,
the universe itself can still expand faster than the speed of light.**
:::

It's kind of like if you're in a car that's going really fast, but the road you're driving on is moving even faster.
Even though your car can't go any faster, it will still seem like you're going really fast because the road is moving so fast underneath you.

Does that make sense? The universe is kind of like the road, and everything inside of it is like the car.
Even though the car (or the things inside the universe) can't go faster than the speed of light,
the universe (or the road) can still expand faster than the speed of light.

So there you have it! The universe is a crazy place, but as long as you remember that rule about the speed of light,
you'll be just fine. Just try not to think about it too much, or your head might explode.
