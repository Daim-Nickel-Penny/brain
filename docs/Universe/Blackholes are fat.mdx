Black holes are some of the heaviest objects in the universe.
In fact, they're so heavy that their gravity is strong enough to pull in things like stars and planets.
That's right, even entire stars can get sucked into a black hole!

But here's the thing: even though black holes are really heavy, they're also really small.
I mean, really small. Like, you could fit a black hole the size of the Earth into a sugar cube and still have room to spare.
But even though they're tiny, they're still super heavy.
It's kind of like if you had a really dense metal that weighed a ton, but you could fit it into the palm of your hand.

Black holes are so dense that they have what's called an "event horizon," which is kind of like a boundary around the black hole.
If you're outside the event horizon, you can still see the black hole and stuff around it.
But if you cross the event horizon and get too close to the black hole, you'll never be able to escape.
It's kind of like if you're trying to swim away from a really strong whirlpool - no matter how hard you swim,
you'll never be able to escape the whirlpool's pull.
