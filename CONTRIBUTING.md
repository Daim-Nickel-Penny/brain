## Contributing to My Second Brain

We welcome contributions to My Second Mind! If you have an idea for an article or note that you'd like to see on the site, please follow these guidelines to submit your contribution:

### Rules

- Keep it safe for work. No NSFW content allowed.
- Stay on topic. My Second Mind is all about coding, space, and music, so try to stick to those themes.
- Be original. Plagiarism is a big no-no, so make sure your content is your own work (or properly attributed, if you're using someone else's material).
- Use good grammar and spelling. We want to make sure your ideas are easy to understand, so take the time to proofread your work.
- Keep it respectful. We want My Second Mind to be a positive and welcoming community, so no hate speech or bullying allowed.

### Technical Details

- To contribute an article or note, create a new folder inside the main topic folder that corresponds to your sub-topic.
- Inside the sub-topic folder, create a new file using the "Create new file" button. Make sure to give the file a name that ends in .md, and use the Markdown syntax to format your text and add links, images, and other elements.
- When you're done writing, create a "pull request" (or "PR" for short) to submit your changes for review. Our team of content ninjas will take a look and make sure everything is good to go. If it is, your contribution will be added to the website for everyone to see!

  Thanks for considering
