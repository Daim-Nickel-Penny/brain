One day, a group of dinosaurs were hanging out in the jungle, trying to come up with something fun to do. Suddenly, one of them had an idea.

"Hey guys, I know a great joke!" said the dinosaur. "Why was the Tyrannosaurus Rex such a terrible singer?"

The other dinosaurs all leaned in, eager to hear the punchline.

"Because he had a really tiny brain and his arms were too short to reach his mouth!"

The other dinosaurs roared with laughter. "That's hilarious!" they exclaimed.

Feeling proud of himself, the dinosaur decided to tell another joke. "Ok, here's another one. Why was the Velociraptor such a terrible basketball player?"

The other dinosaurs waited with bated breath for the answer.

"Because every time he tried to shoot the ball, it would always end up in the raptor's nest!"

The other dinosaurs couldn't stop laughing at the silly jokes. They spent the rest of the day telling each other dinosaur-themed jokes and having a great time.

In the end, the group of dinosaurs learned that laughter truly is the best medicine, and that a good joke can bring friends together and make even the grimmest of situations a little brighter.

After a few hours of nonstop joke-telling, the group of dinosaurs were starting to get a little bit tired. But they didn't want the fun to end just yet, so they decided to play a game of hide and seek.

The dinosaurs all scattered, looking for the best hiding spot they could find. The stegosaurus, Steve, decided to hide behind a big rock. He figured that with his spikes, he would be nearly impossible to spot.

As the other dinosaurs counted to ten, Steve closed his eyes and tried to blend in with the rock as much as possible. But just as he was getting comfortable, he heard a loud noise.

"Found you!" yelled a voice.

Steve opened his eyes to see the velociraptor, who had been searching for him, standing right in front of him with a big grin on his face.

"Darn it," Steve grumbled. "I thought my spikes would have given me away."

"Nope, you were completely hidden," the velociraptor chuckled. "But your snoring gave you away!"

Steve's eyes widened in shock. "I don't snore!" he protested.

The velociraptor just chuckled and patted Steve on the back. "Sure you don't," he said with a wink.

The other dinosaurs all came running over, laughing at Steve's predicament. And from that day on, Steve became known as the snoring stegosaurus, much to his embarrassment.

But despite the teasing, Steve couldn't help but laugh along with his friends. After all, there was nothing like a good joke to bring a group of dinosaurs together.
